# Architecture Documentation

> **Status:** v1 complete — the `audit/` package runs, and every pack (`IDX`, `AGT`, `EXEC`, `CMD`, `DOC`, `NAV`, `SEC`, `TOOL`, `CI`, `TST`, `BASE`, `CON` and the informational `HYG` set) is live. All 54 scoreable checks are implemented; only the blocked `CON-01` is not evaluated, and Tier-C probe checks report `UNKNOWN` unless probes are permitted. Pages below describe the design of record and the current implementation state. See [`docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`](../STYLE_GUIDE.md) § 1.3 (Empirical Grounding).

> **Related:** the brownfield recipes (in development) build on this engine; their documentation is at [`brownfield-recipes/docs/`](../../../docs/architecture/README.md).

## Framework Dependencies

This tool implements Phase 1 of an external methodology. Its normative source is
the codebase agentic-readiness framework at the root of this repository (see the [Phased Approach](../../../../brownfield-legacy/Phased-Approach.md)).
Where the two disagree, the framework wins and this tool has a defect.

The framework is the root of this repository, and the tool finds it from its own location: `--verify-rules`
needs no flag, and every report records its HEAD as `framework_revision`. `--framework <path>` selects a different
checkout, and is required when the tool has been copied out of the repository.
