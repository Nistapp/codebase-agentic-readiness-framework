# Check Catalogue

> **Related ADRs:** [ADR-0003](../adrs/0003-component-depth-declared-depth-1.md) · [ADR-0004](../adrs/0004-no-llm-in-v1.md)
> **Status:** Live for the `IDX`, `AGT`, `EXEC`, `CMD`, `DOC`, `NAV`, `SEC`, `TOOL`, `CI`, `TST`, `BASE`, `CON` and `HYG` packs (the `CON-04` emitter included); every catalogued check is implemented save the blocked `CON-01`. This page is the design of record; `audit/rules/registry.py` is its executable form, and `python3 -m audit --list-checks` prints the current truth.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The executable rules live in code, not here.** This catalogue holds the id, tier, phase anchor, severity and
> evidence rule for every check — the rationale for each family is in
> [Why These Checks](../user-overview/03-why-these-checks.md). Any change to a check's semantics updates this page
> and its rule pack in the same change set.

## 1. Summary

| Group | Checks | Tier A | Tier B | Tier C |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `IDX` Discovery & index | 3 | 2 | — | 1 |
| `AGT` Agent governance | 10 | 2 | 8 | — |
| `DOC` Documentation contract | 4 | 3 | 1 | — |
| `CMD` Command surface | 4 | — | 4 | — |
| `TOOL` Tooling | 6 | 3 | 3 | — |
| `CI` CI | 3 | — | 3 | — |
| `BASE` Baselines & ratchet | 4 | 2 | 2 | — |
| `CON` Constraints | 4 | — | 3 | — |
| `EXEC` Execution determinism | 7 | 2 | 5 | — |
| `TST` Tests | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| `NAV` Navigation | 3 | 1 | 2 | — |
| `SEC` Security hygiene | 3 | — | 3 | — |
| **Total catalogued** | **56** | **17** | **36** | **2** |

Plus **13 informational checks** (`NAV-04`, `NAV-05`, `HYG-01`–`HYG-11`), reported and never scored.

Of the 56: `CON-01` carries weight 0 in v1 (its artifact contract is undefined at framework level) and `CON-04` is
an emitter rather than a check, leaving **54 scoreable checks** in v1.

> [!NOTE]
> The tier columns sum to 55, not 56: `CON-04` is an emitter with no tier. The variant research added `AGT-10`.
> Earlier revisions of this table carried per-group tier splits that disagreed with their own rows — `--list-checks`
> is the executable truth, and a mismatch between it and this page is a defect in this page.

## 2. `IDX` — Discovery & Index

| ID | Check | Tier | Sev | Evidence rule | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `IDX-01` | `codebase-memory-mcp` registered for this repository | A | BLOCKER | A project- or user-level MCP config names the server and the target path | Implemented |
| `IDX-02` | An index exists for this checkout | A | BLOCKER | The index store contains a project whose root path resolves to the target | Implemented |
| `IDX-03` | Index freshness | C | DEGRADER | Indexed git SHA equals target `HEAD`; probe only | Implemented |

---

## 3. `AGT` — Agent Governance

Component-scoped: `AGT-02` reports a ratio over declared components; the remaining checks evaluate the root file
and are reported per component when a component-level file exists.

The pack is driven by **one data structure in code** — `audit/rules/variants.py` — recording every instruction-file
variant per harness with the documentation URL it came from and a `last_verified` date, plus the config-indirection
keys, the shadow pairs, and the globs that only *look* like instructions. A filename-only check is wrong in both
directions: it calls a `CLAUDE.md` repository ungoverned, and an `AGENTS.override.md` repository governed. The table
rots by design (Windsurf → Devin Desktop; Antigravity CLI replacing Gemini CLI), so every report carries a
`ruleset_hash` over the table and the catalogue — rot shows up in provenance instead of being inferred from a
suspicious verdict.

## 9. `CON` — Constraints

> [!WARNING]
> `CON-01` is **blocked**: the framework requires initial Constraint Engineering allow/deny lists as a Phase-1
> deliverable but defines no artifact name or schema for them anywhere in the framework or its templates. Until
> that contract exists this check carries weight 0 and the audit instead *emits* a draft list derived from the
> scan (`CON-04`).

## 15. Adding a Check

1. Assign the next id in the appropriate group.
2. State tier, phase anchor, severity, and a **falsifiable** evidence rule — one that a reviewer can apply to a
   fixture and reach the same verdict.
3. Add the failure mode to [Why These Checks](../user-overview/03-why-these-checks.md). No failure mode, no check.
4. Emit a short human `summary` and, where the check has table-shaped facts, a typed `data` payload from
   `audit/rules/payloads.py` (ADR-0007). The renderer builds check tables from the payload `kind`, never
   from prose, and editorial wording belongs in `audit/report/presentation.py`, not in the check.
5. Add a broken fixture that fails exactly this check and nothing else.
6. Add the row to the summary table and to the pack's framework anchor before merging.
