# How to Read the Report

> **Goal:** Turn an audit report into an ordered work queue without over-reading the score.
> **Audience:** CTOs, engineering leads, engineers
> **Status:** Live for the implemented packs (`AGT`, `EXEC`, `CMD`, `SEC`, `TOOL`, `CI`); the report shape below is what the tool emits today.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] A completed scan ([Run an audit](run-an-audit.md))
- [ ] Both outputs: the Markdown page for reading, the JSON for filtering

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Read the provenance block first

It tells you what the report is *about*: the target path, git SHA, whether the tree was dirty, the tool version,
and the framework revision whose rules were applied. A report against a dirty tree or the wrong revision is a
report about a different repository.

### Step 2: Read the blockers, and stop there

The Markdown report opens with a **Provenance** table, a **Scorecard** (verdict distribution and
findings by severity), the **Unattested** list, then one **findings table per severity**. Each finding
row carries the check id, its title, the verdict, the concrete specifics, the evidence (`path:line`),
and the fix. Blockers are the only section that requires action before onboarding an agent; degraders
can be scheduled, cosmetics can be ignored indefinitely.

| Severity | What to do |
|---|---|
| **BLOCKER** | Fix before any agent work. These are the findings that make agent output unverifiable or the repository unsafe to touch. |
| **DEGRADER** | Schedule. Each one costs accuracy or tokens on every task. |
| **COSMETIC** | Note and move on. |

The full **Appendix — full check results** table lists every applicable check, including the `PASS`
and `UNKNOWN` rows the findings tables omit. The Markdown is rendered from the JSON report, so the two
always describe the same run and the Markdown can be re-rendered from a saved `audit-report.json`
(ADR-0007).

### Step 3: Read the unattested list

Five properties are listed as unattested on every report, always: whether the index is *used*, whether baselines
are *adequate*, whether the suite is *trustworthy*, whether docs are *accurate*, whether the gate will be
*honoured*. These are the items a scan cannot settle, and they are printed so the score is never read as a
guarantee.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Absence of a finding is not evidence of quality. A check that could not gather evidence is `UNKNOWN`, and
> `UNKNOWN` is never counted as a pass. If the report shows `UNKNOWN` items, treat them as open questions about
> the *tool's* coverage, not about the repository.

### Step 4: Read `PARTIAL` findings as ratios

A per-component check reports as `PARTIAL` with a ratio, because a monorepo where 3 of 7 components have
governance is not "passing" or "failing" — it is 43% done, and the ratio is the useful number.

### Step 5: Filter the JSON for work assignment

```bash
# Everything a specific team should look at
python3 -c "
import json
d = json.load(open('audit-report.json'))
for f in d['findings']:
    if f['severity'] == 'BLOCKER':
        print(f\"{f['check']:<8} {f['statement']}\")
        print(f\"         evidence: {f['evidence'][0]['path']}\")
"
```

## Verification

You have read the report correctly if you can answer, without opening the JSON: how many blockers exist, which
requirement each one maps to, and which properties the scan could not verify.
