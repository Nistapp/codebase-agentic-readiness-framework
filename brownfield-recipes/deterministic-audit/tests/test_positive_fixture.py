"""The positive fixture: a freshly scaffolded project must not fail the implemented checks.

``python-agentic-bootstrap``'s scaffold is Phase-1-complete by construction, so it is the natural
positive fixture for this audit. It is **generated in the test run, never vendored**: a vendored copy
stops being evidence the moment the scaffolder changes. If a scaffold ever fails a **scoreable**
check, one of the two tools is wrong — that is a defect, not a false positive to tune away. The
informational checks (`HYG`, `NAV-04`/`05`) are reported but never scored, and the scaffold
deliberately leaves a license, branch protection and release automation to the adopter, so they are
outside this contract.

The scaffolder is located from ``AUDIT_BOOTSTRAP`` or the known sibling path. When it is absent the
test **fails loudly** rather than skipping (AGENTS.md §10.13 forbids weakening a test to get green).
