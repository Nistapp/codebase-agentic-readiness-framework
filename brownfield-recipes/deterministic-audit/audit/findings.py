"""Stage S10 — the finding model.

Every finding is phrased as **"an agent cannot X today because Y"**. That phrasing is not style:
it is what makes the report usable as a work queue instead of a compliance checklist.

Finding ids are derived from ``check id + path`` and never from a counter, so two runs over the
same repository produce comparable findings and a baseline diff is meaningful.
