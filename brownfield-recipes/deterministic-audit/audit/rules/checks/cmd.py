"""`CMD` pack — command surface.

Anchor: `brownfield-legacy/Phased-Approach.md` § Activities.

Implemented here: `CMD-01` … `CMD-04`.

The framework's standardized command surface is seven verbs on one runner. Each check reads the
runner manifests once through `audit.rules.checks._common`; this pack never reparses a manifest.

What each check reads and what makes it `UNKNOWN` rather than `FAIL`:

* **CMD-01** — every framework verb (`audit.stack.VERBS`) resolves, and resolves on **one** runner.
  `_common.resolve_all_verbs` is read in full, so a verb declared on two runners is visible as a
  stray second definition. Missing verbs ⇒ `FAIL`; verbs split across (or duplicated on) more than
  one runner ⇒ `PARTIAL` — the stray definition is `CMD-03`'s territory. With **no runner manifest
  at all** the verdict is `UNKNOWN`: an unrecognised ecosystem is not proof of absence.
* **CMD-02** — the `check` verb's body invokes a format-check, a typecheck and a test command.
  Indirection through another verb (`npm run format:check`) and documented tool equivalents
  (``prettier --check``, ``tsc --noEmit``, ``pytest``, …) both count. Some concerns present ⇒
  `PARTIAL`; none ⇒ `FAIL`; no runner ⇒ `UNKNOWN`.
* **CMD-03** — a second runner may define `check` only as a delegation to the first; a second runner
  that composes the gate itself is a finding. Detection is textual and deterministic: a delegating
  `check` invokes ``check`` through another runner. No runner ⇒ `UNKNOWN`.
* **CMD-04** — no read-only verb (`VERBS` minus `audit.probes.MUTATING_VERBS`) invokes a write verb.
  Both runner indirection (``npm run format``) and direct writer invocations (``prettier --write``,
  ``tsc`` without ``--noEmit``, ``rm -rf``) are detected, so a formatter's explicit-run write form is
  caught while its check form (``format:check``) is not. No runner ⇒ `UNKNOWN`.

Two deliberate limits, recorded rather than hidden. **Command parsing is textual**: shell operators
are split on, not interpreted, so a verb hidden inside a quoted string is not seen. **Runner
resolution is v1's**: only the manifests `_common` understands can contribute verbs, so an ecosystem
outside that set reports `UNKNOWN`, never a false `PASS`.
