"""`CON` pack — constraints.

Anchor: `brownfield-legacy/Phased-Approach.md` § Key Deliverables ("Allow/deny lists").

Implemented here: `CON-02`, `CON-03`, and the `CON-04` emitter. `CON-01` is deliberately **not**
touched: the framework requires initial allow/deny lists as a Phase-1 deliverable but defines no
artifact name or schema, so the registry keeps it `blocked` with weight 0. This pack does not invent
an artifact contract, and it does not require one.

What each check reads and what makes it `UNKNOWN` rather than `FAIL`:

* **CON-02** — *test directories protected*. Test directories are located from the scan (a directory
  segment named ``test``/``tests``/``spec``/``specs``/``__tests__``) plus the filesystem. A
  dedicated constraint / allow-deny file — a documented name set of agent ignore files
  (``.cursorignore``, ``.aiderignore``, …) and explicit constraint files
  (``constraints.yaml``/``.json``, ``allowlist.txt``/``denylist.txt``) — that denies every test
  directory is a `PASS`; one that denies only some is `PARTIAL`; one that denies none is `FAIL`.
  With **no** constraint file the premise is absent, so the check never passes: ignore rules or a
  CI guard that protects the test
  directories is a `PARTIAL` (the mechanism is named), and nothing at all is `UNKNOWN`. Because
  CON-01 defines no artifact, this check is deliberately artifact-agnostic and never requires one.
* **CON-03** — *`artefacts/` excluded from the index and agent reads*. Candidate roots are the
  scratch spellings (``artefacts``, ``artifacts``) and the agent/tool state directories
  (``.codebase-memory``, ``.opencode``, ``.agentic-tdd``). A root that exists is covered when an
  ignore rule matches it; a **tracked** member of any root is a `FAIL`. When the roots are covered
  but git cannot report the tracked set, the untracked half is `UNKNOWN` — never inferred — while
  the rule-coverage half still evaluates (the same degradation `SEC-01`/`DOC-03` use).
* **CON-04** — the emitter, not a scored check. It returns a `CheckOutcome` like every other check,
  but it becomes `PASS` only when the operator asked for the draft with ``--emit-baseline``; without
  the flag it is `UNKNOWN`, and it is refused outright if the resolved output would land inside the
  target (ADR-0002). The draft is deterministic: fixed sections, sorted entries.

CON-04's output location is a contract choice not yet ratified by the framework (the framework
defines no artifact contract — see CON-01). The least-surprising option is taken: the same ``--out``
directory the report is written to, gated by the already-reserved ``--emit-baseline`` flag, with the
filename the remediation how-to already names (``docs/how-to/hand-findings-to-remediation.md``).
The emitter writes to a module-level target set by the CLI before the scan; nothing else reads it.

Deliberate limits, recorded rather than hidden. Ignore matching is the documented subset in
``audit.ignore`` (anchoring and ``**`` approximated). Constraint-file detection is a documented
**root-level** name set, not a schema; a constraint file under an unrecognised name, format or
depth is not seen and degrades to the ignore/CI fallback. Test-directory discovery is
directory-based; a suite laid out as loose ``*_test.py`` files with no test-named directory is not
seen and degrades to `UNKNOWN`. CI
protection is a textual heuristic (a workflow line that names a test directory together with a
deny/protect keyword). The emitter writes exactly one artifact (``constraints.draft.yaml``); the
other S12 remediation inputs are out of scope for this pack.
