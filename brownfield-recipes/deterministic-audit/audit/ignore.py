"""git-aware tracked-file access and a documented-subset ignore matcher.

Scope contract
--------------
This is a read-only helper layer for checks that need to know *which files matter*: which paths git
tracks (SEC-01/03, EXEC-05) and whether an ignore rule covers a path (DOC-03, CON-03). It never
writes to the target, never mutates a git repository, never installs anything, and makes no network
request.

Documented subset
-----------------
Ignore matching implements the same **documented subset** of gitignore semantics that
``audit.scan`` has always used, and deliberately does not overclaim:

* a rule is matched with :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` against both the repository-relative path and the
  basename;
* **anchored** patterns (``/dist``) are not interpreted as anchored and may therefore fail to match
  the path they were written for;
* **negation** lines (``!keep``) are dropped entirely, so a later ``!`` cannot re-include a path;
* ``**`` is treated as a plain glob, not the gitignore "any depth" operator.

Callers that need certainty must treat a negative or ambiguous answer as ``UNKNOWN`` — never as
``PASS``. When git is unavailable, the target is not a repository, or the command fails,
:func:`tracked_files` returns ``None`` so callers degrade to ``UNKNOWN`` rather than infer.
