"""Stage S11 — report writers.

The report is the product. Two properties matter more than formatting:

* **The score is never presented alone.** The blockers and the unattested list travel with it
  (docs: The Readiness Model § 6), because a number without its caveats is the failure mode this
  design exists to prevent.
* **The report says which checks were not implemented.** A scan that silently omits half the
  catalogue looks identical to a scan that found nothing wrong.

Default output path is the current working directory. If the CWD is inside the target, the writer
refuses unless ``--out`` is given: a scanner that drops a file into the repository it is auditing
has broken the read-only invariant (ADR-0002).
