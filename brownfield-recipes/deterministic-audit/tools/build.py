"""Build the single-file distributable: dist/audit.pyz.

The package tree is the source of truth; this produces the one artifact you hand to someone else.
It needs nothing but the standard library, which is the entire reason the tool ships this way — it
must run on a machine where nothing is installed and the target's toolchain does not exist yet.

    python3 tools/build.py            # build, print size and the archive entry point
    ./dist/audit.pyz <target>         # run it

Two constraints come from zipapp and are easy to get wrong:

1. the archive root needs an entry point — passing ``main=`` makes zipapp generate a root
   ``__main__.py`` shim, so the package tree itself needs no root-level file
2. that shim calls the entry point with **no arguments** and discards what it returns, which is why
   ``audit.__main__.main`` accepts ``argv=None`` and the entry point is ``entry``, which exits with
   ``main()``'s code

Excluded from the archive: tests, docs, dist and bytecode. Nothing inside a .pyz can be read with
``Path(__file__)`` — the archive is not a directory — so shipped data must go through
``importlib.resources``. This project keeps its tables in code, so it has no such data file.
